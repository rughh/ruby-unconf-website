    <a class="sponsor__logo" href="http://www.epages.com/" target="_blank" style="height:100px;"><img src="assets/images/sponsors/epages-logo.svg" style="height:55px;"></a>
    <br />
    ePages is one of the world’s most popular cloud solutions for small and medium-sized online businesses. We live and breathe ecommerce.

    We focus on an ecosystem of microservices for our [highly scalable and flexible ecommerce platform](https://developer.epages.com/). The backend is based on Java, SpringBoot, Docker, and Kubernetes and is decoupled via a REST API from a ReactJS frontend. That’s how we tie an attractive package for our merchants to hit the ground running.
    And we are Ruby enthusiasts! For our in-house tools, such as provisioning, pricelist, or BI software, we rely on Ruby-based technology. Having the RubyUnconf in Hamburg is a home run for us.

Founded in 2010 and written in ruby on rails, today more than 600 green labels, designers and retailers are selling more than 150.000 products via avocadostore. As everything is about sustainability, all products have to match one of our ten sustainabiltiy criteria, such as "vegan", "cradle to cradle", "fair & social" and "recycling/upcycling" just to name the most common four. Avocadostore is growing fast, as are our ideas for features and ways to work in the future - not only regarding sustainability, but also technology!
