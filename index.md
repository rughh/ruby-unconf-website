### Getting there

The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station "Mundsburg", which is about a 7 Minute ride away from the central station ("Hauptbahnhof").

It's probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can't really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.

If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and the the U-Bahn to Mundsburg.

### Surroundings

The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake ("Aussenalster") which is probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny spring day.

Next to the train station "Mundsburg" is one of Hamburgs largest shopping malls which includes a cinema (if you don't like partying on saturday night, for example) - Be warned though, all movies there are probably shown in german.
